# iOS-Inspired UX/UI Design Prompt for Excel Analytics Platform (Exelio)

## Overall Design Philosophy

Create a web application that feels like a native iOS app translated to the web. The design should embody Apple's design principles: simplicity, elegance, intuitive navigation, and premium quality. Every interaction should feel fluid, purposeful, and delightful.

## Visual Design Language

### Color Palette & Aesthetics
- **Primary Colors**: Use iOS system colors - subtle blues (#007AFF), clean whites, and sophisticated grays
- **Background**: Dynamic gradients similar to iOS wallpapers, with subtle mesh gradients that shift based on user interactions
- **Accent Colors**: Vibrant yet refined colors for CTAs and highlights (iOS green for success, orange for warnings)
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support with true blacks and subtle grays, matching iOS dark mode aesthetics

### Typography
- **Font Family**: San Francisco (SF Pro) or closest web equivalent
- **Hierarchy**: Clear typographic scale with distinct weights - thin, regular, medium, semibold
- **Readability**: Excellent contrast ratios, generous line heights, and comfortable letter spacing
- **Dynamic Type**: Responsive text sizing that scales beautifully across devices

### Visual Elements
- **Depth & Layering**: Subtle shadows, blur effects, and layering to create depth without being overwhelming
- **Translucency**: Frosted glass effects (backdrop-filter blur) for overlays, modals, and navigation elements
- **Rounded Corners**: Consistent border-radius throughout - larger for cards (16-20px), smaller for buttons (8-12px)
- **Minimalist Icons**: Clean, thin-lined icons matching iOS iconography style

## Logo & Branding

### Logo Concept
- **Style**: Modern, minimal icon that could sit comfortably on an iOS home screen
